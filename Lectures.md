# Software Language Engineering Lectures

## Lecture 1

Tradeoffs of performance and useability, as well as scale is very important.

A Software Language needs the following:
- Syntax
  - How the language is formed, the rules of the language.
- Semantics
  - The meaning of the syntax
- Tooling
  - Not just the semantics, also able to reformat, visualize and other things.
- Transformation
  - Many semantics and tooling are transformations. 
  - So is compilation
- Analysis
  - Can we derive properties? Error msgs, concurrency, consistency and performance, etc
- Representation
  - To represent the source code in a way that SLEngineers can modify it.
